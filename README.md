# Holomenu

I'm attempting to make a dmenu style launcher working on both
X11 and Wayland. I mean there's [bemenu](https://github.com/Cloudef/bemenu), but
unfortunately I didn't write it myself, hence this project. Also I'm still very much
a zig newbee and this thing seems like a good first project.
